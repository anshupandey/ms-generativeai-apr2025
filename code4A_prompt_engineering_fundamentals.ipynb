      "\n",
      "Now, quantum computing is like having a magical librarian who can open many books at once and explore multiple paths simultaneously. This magic comes from two main quantum properties: superposition and entanglement.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Superposition**: In the quantum world, things can exist in multiple states at once. This means a quantum bit, or \"qubit,\" can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time, much like spinning a coin that can simultaneously be both heads and tails while in the air. This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of possibilities all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Entanglement**: This is a special connection between qubits where the state of one qubit can instantly influence the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. It’s like having two magical books on different shelves that always show the same page number even if you only change one of them. This connectivity allows quantum computers to perform complex operations more efficiently.\n",

      "However, building practical quantum computers is extremely challenging due to issues like qubit stability and error rates. But as research advances, we may one day achieve computing capabilities far beyond what we can do today with classical computers.\n"

      "- It initializes a list `fibonacci_series` with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.\n",
      "- A `while` loop is used to calculate the next term in the series by summing the last two terms in the list, and this new term is appended to the list.\n",
      "- The loop continues until the list contains the desired number of terms.\n",
      "- Finally, the function returns the list truncated to the first `n_terms` elements to handle cases where `n_terms` is 1.\n",
